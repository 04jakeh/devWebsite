        <p class="textThree">I love performing music, especially with friends, trading spontaneous phrases all kept within a set of boundaries and rules that create a foundation for infinite conversation, it takes you to another place that you can not describe but you can only feel. <br><br>
            I started playing classical clarinet at the age of 8 and moved onto classical sax at aged 10 but never really took the instrument seriously until I was introduced to jazz when I was 18. It opened up a whole new world for me and I’ve never looked back. <br><br>
            After graduating from the Kent University with a BSc in Music Technology I joined a Hip Hop brass outfit called “Dat Brass” this genre of music was quite alien to me at the time but it didn’t take me long for me to warm to the ground-breaking drops and blistering improvised solos that I was given the green light to do and also marrying it up to my skills in music production. The gigs POP OFF. <br><br>
            I was then invited to join a pop/reggae/funk band called “Bare Jams.” This type of music was able to give me the musical satisfaction of writing and performing complex harmonies and lines as part of a horn section as well as being able to improvise long “story like” solos over certain sections. <br>
            Since then I have had the privilege of working, performing and studying with many amazing artists such as Craig Charles, Bare Jams, Dat Brass, Seb Skelly, Don Johnson, Alex Han, Jim Knight, Mornington Lockett as well as many others. <br><br>
