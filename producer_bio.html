        <p class="textThree"> I have always had a passion for music production and technology and over the past 6 years I have been fine tuning and nurturing these skills.<br><br>
            By combining my knowledge of the saxophone and music theory I have been able to experiment and create some fun & unique sounds. As well as being able to work with artists across a multitude of genres including, Drum ’N’ Bass, Jazz, Reggae, Pop, Hip Hop, Trap and Funk.<br><br>
            When I am not working with clients I am, gigging recording & producing the original projects I am in, “dat Brass” & “Bare Jams.” <br><br>
            Having knowledge over many aspects of each role that goes into a live performance is crucial in having control over each intricate aspect of your sound.<br><br>
